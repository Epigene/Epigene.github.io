title: Host Virtualbox Linux on Windows machine for Rails Development
---
Developing Rails apps requires a \*nix platform, because Windows' terminal leaves much to be desired.  
Macs tend to be expensive, especially for tinkering around.  
Enter Linux in Virtualbox!  

#### Pros
1. Free! Turn that Windows gaming rig into a respectable development workstation with open source tools.

#### Cons
1. You will be using Linux, you better know what you are doing...
2. Can be a pain to set up.  

#### Difficulty and Time
Difficulty: Medium - lots of tools and environments involved, but mainly configuration problemsolving.  
Time: A good long afternoon.

## 1. The Windows Host
I had a Windows7 with 8gb RAM and spare 12GB of disk space.  
Dedicated 5gb of the ram to the virtual Linux and all works well.  

#### 1-1 Install Virtualbox  
Head over to [Oracle homepage](https://www.virtualbox.org/).  
Grab and install:  

1. VirtualBox <version> for Windows hosts
2. The extension pack  

#### 1-2 Get a Linux Distro
I went with [Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/).

#### 1-3 Create a Virtual Machine
Look up how to do it.  
Make sure you mount the Linux distro image before booting it.  

#### 1-4 Install Linux
After boot you should be prompted by Linux installer.  
Have it finish successfully.  
Unmount the install image after setup and reboot the VM.  

#### 1-5 Install Guest Additions
Open the Terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T  

```
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils
```

Reboot VM, increase resolution to native and go Fullscreen mode with RCtrl+F

## 2. The Linux Guest

### 2-1 Terminal and Shell
I use Fish shell.  
Tilda allows for nice customization.

#### 2-1-1 Fish Setup

Install Fish shell

```
$ sudo apt-get install fish
```

Install Oh-My-Fish

```
$ curl -L http://get.oh-my.fish | fish
```

Set Fish as default login shell

```
# get where fish installed
$ which fish

# add fish to shells
$ echo "<fish path>" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells

# make fish the default shell
$ chsh -s <fish path>
```

Set theme and some aliases

```
# theme
$ omf install robbyrussell
$ omf theme robbyrussell

# nano the fish config
$ nano ~/.config/fish/config.fish

    alias opsh="sudo nano /home/augusts/.config/fish/config.fish "
    alias ls="command ls -A --color --group-directories-first"

    set -g -x fish_greeting ''
    echo -e "Proceed to \033[38;5;208mfishy\033[0;00m business!"
```

#### 2-1-2 Tilda setup

```
$ sudo apt-get install tilda fonts-dejavu

$ tilda
```

Configure:

1. Where you want the tilda window to be
2. Use of 12pt DejaVU mono Book fonts-dejavu
3. Use of initial command to run fish

### Misc Packages

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs libxslt-dev libxml2-dev
```

### Keys
You want to map CapsLock key to act as Return.  
You might also want to remap other keys.

Start by consulting the [in-depth thread](http://askubuntu.com/questions/254424/how-can-i-change-what-keys-on-my-keyboard-do-how-can-i-create-custom-keyboard/257497#257497).  
Here's a key symbol [reference](http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/List_of_Keysyms_Recognised_by_Xmodmap).  

To make changes permanent you need two files

1. `~/.Xmodmap` \| with contents generated by running `xmodmap -pke > ~/.Xmodmap` after keymapping
2. `~/.xinitrc` \| with contents "xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap", this will source the file
3. You may need to trigger the lock removal on every boot, boot level override (via Upstart) works poorly, just place it in fish config.

#### Caps to Enter

```
xmodmap -e "keycode 66 = Return" -e 'clear Lock'
```

#### Grave(tilde) to Delete

```
xmodmap -e "keycode 49 = Delete Delete Delete"
```

### RVM

```
# add gpg key
$ gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3

# Install rvm, ignore the warnings about fish
$ curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby

# Download fish functions
curl -L --create-dirs -o ~/.config/fish/functions/rvm.fish https://raw.github.com/lunks/fish-nuggets/master/functions/rvm.fish

# Activate them
$ echo "rvm default" >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish

# Verify
$ rvm --version
```

### Postgres

Install the packages

```
$ sudo apt-get install postgresql-common postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev python-dev
```

```
$ sudo -u postgres createuser <your username>

# If you would like to set a password for the user, you can do the following
sudo -u postgres psql
\password <your username>

# Give create priviledges to user
ALTER USER <your username> CREATEDB;
ALTER USER <your username> WITH SUPERUSER;
\q
```

### Redis

#### Install deps
```
sudo apt-get update
```
```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential tcl8.5
```
#### Get code
```
wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-stable.tar.gz
```
unrar
```
tar xzf redis-stable.tar.gz
```

```
cd redis-stable
```
#### Build from source
```
make

sudo make install
```

#### Setup deamon
```
cd utils
```

```
sudo ./install_server.sh # the default 6379 port is fine for development
```

#### Test
```
redis-cli
```
```
> ping
```

### Development DNS
Accessing local webapps via localhost or IP is cumbersome and does not represent production environment.

We will set up `*.dev` TLD for development needs.

This will be a two-step process.  
First we will muck with hosts to redirect all requests to .dev to the localhost 127.0.0.1 IP address.  
Second, we will reconfigure the IP table to redirect requests to 127.0.0.1:80 to 127.0.0.1:3000.  
This will produce the effect that a server started with `rails s -b 127.0.0.1 -p 3000` will be accessible at `http://<anything>.dev`

#### Change Hosts
Consult [this discussion](http://askubuntu.com/a/233209/254615) for insight.

#### Change IP table

```
sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -d 127.0.0.1 -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1:3000
```

See [this discussion](http://serverfault.com/a/54371/294240) for insight.

## 3. Tools

### 3-1 The Editor
Go with what you like and are familiar with.  
I like and am familiar with GitHub's [Atom](https://atom.io/).

## 4. First App
By now it should be possible to get to Rails' "Hello World" screen of a new app.  

#### 4-1 Set Up Ruby

```
$ rvm install ruby-2.3.1

$ rvm use 2.3.1@first-app --create

$ gem install bundler

$ gem install rails
```

#### 4-2 Set Up a Rails Project With Git

```
$ mkdir ~/Projects/first-app

$ cd ~/Projects/first-app

$ git init

$ rails new . -BMCT --database=postgresql --skip-keeps --skip-turbolinks
```

#### 4-3 Configure DB

```
# in /config/database.yml

default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  database: first-app

development:
  <<: *default

test:
  <<: *default
  database: first-app_test

production:
  <<: *default
```

```
$ rails db:create db:migrate
```

#### Run The Server

```
$ rails s -b 127.0.0.1 -p 3000
```

The app should be reachable at http://local.dev

Yayifications!
